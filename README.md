This repo replicates simulations for convolutional-smooth SVM.

The figures can be replicated by running the notebook `simulations.ipynb'.

Figures are stored in `./outputs/figures' directory. Data, generated by simulations, which underpin these figures are stored in '/outputs' directory.

The implementation of convolution-smoothed SVM and of unregularised SVM can be found in '/src/models.py' file.
